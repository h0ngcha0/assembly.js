assembly.js
===========

Assembly css and js files in the local machine into one HTML file.

For sites like tictail which only allows you to put css and js files in
one gigantic html files, it is mentally impossible to work with it.

This is a simple script that will look at the script and link tag,
looking for local css and js files and replace it with whatever
contents that are stored in those files.

This way you can put your js and css files in a structured way.
